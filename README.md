## Description

If you are translating a WordPress plugin or theme and encounter a large number of cities and/or country names, then these files can help you finish your task much quicker.
Simply download either the editable .po-file or the machine-readable .mo-file to your computer and then import it into your translation project at https://translate.wordpress.org/. The platform is able to import any of these two formats. Sometimes the .mo-file may work better, simply since it is smaller.
When you import translations to https://translate.wordpress.org/ the platform will simply disregard strings that don't match 100% with any project string in your source language, so this operation is virtually risk-free.
